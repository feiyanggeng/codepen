    When using npm or Yarn, if you have 100 projects using a dependency, you will have 100 copies of that dependency saved
    on disk. This is caused by the use of a flat node_modules structure. However, with pnpm, the dependency will be stored
    in a content-addressable store, so:
    
    If you depend on different versions of the dependency, only the files that differ are added to the store. For instance,
    if it has 100 files, and a new version has a change in only one of those files, pnpm update will only add 1 new file to
    the store, instead of cloning the entire dependency just for the singular change.
    All the files are saved in a single place on the disk. When packages are installed, their files are hard-linked from
    that single place, consuming no additional disk space. This allows you to share dependencies of the same version across
    projects.
    As a result, you save a lot of space on your disk proportional to the number of projects and dependencies, and you have
    a lot faster installations!
    
    If you'd like more details about the unique node_modules structure that pnpm creates and why it works fine with the
    Node.js ecosystem, read this small article, and our corresponding documentation about the content-addressable store:
